    {
        question: "How is DigitalRise different from a typical marketing agency?",
        answer: "We don't just run ads or build websites in isolation. We build a complete growth ecosystem. Every piece of your digital presence—from your site's architecture to your ad creative and backend automations—is connected to feed data into a central system that compounds results over time.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you work with startups or established enterprises?",
        answer: "We specialize in working with high-growth brands that are ready to scale. Whether you're a funded startup needing to prove traction or an established enterprise looking to modernize your acquisition channels, our systems are built for velocity and data-driven decision making.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is the typical timeline for seeing results?",
        answer: "Our 'Build + Launch' sprint typically takes 2-4 weeks to get your core infrastructure and campaigns live. You'll start seeing data immediately, with optimization cycles beginning in week 4. Most clients see significant ROI improvements within the first 60-90 days as the system learns.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I hire you for just one service (e.g., only SEO)?",
        answer: "While we can execute specific services, our methodology works best when we control the full loop. However, we often start with a single high-leverage area (like a site rebuild or ad account audit) and expand from there once trust and results are established.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you offer white-label services for other agencies?",
        answer: "We occasionally partner with select agencies for specialized technical implementations or AI automation builds. Contact us directly to discuss partnership opportunities.",
